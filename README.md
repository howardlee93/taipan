# taipan

a react clone of the classic game [Taipan] (<https://taipangame.com/>)

## changes

streamlined fighting pirates: game will calculate whether you are robbed or you gain booty based on number of guns you have

instead of being robbed, you are taxed

combines fix ship and upgrade ship

no debt -- never played it with that option so skipping it

## todo/improvements

check difficulty and adjust prices - make sense?

victory conditions and game over: is 100 turns too long?

viewport changes, need to keep it fixed

make mobile first?
